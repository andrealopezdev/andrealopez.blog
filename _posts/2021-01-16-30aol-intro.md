30 what? Acts of logic.. 
as in 30 times in 2021 I will be tapping my resources to bring 30 tech projects to life! Design, development, and documenting here..

Each project in this series will use a mix of hardware and software techology stacks. My only criteria for each project will be that it must be fun to build and fun to share with you! I am scoping out the first of the thirty projects this weekend and it may or may not involve a cloud service, mobile app, and an LED screen. üòâ

This series is partly an exercise to practice shipping and to learn/test out services that I've been curious about, but it is also an excuse to start infusing my love for art/science into this logical part of my life.

A post will be shared here per project but I might more regularly share updates via <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter.username }}" target="_blank">
    <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
  </a>.

As the year continues to speed along I will likely limit the size of each project to be able to meet the mark. I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Talk soon
